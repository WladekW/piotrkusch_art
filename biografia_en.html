                  I only saw Piotr Kusch's works in Laski as I stayed there when organizing an exhibition about angels.
                  It was a profound
                  experience for me.
                </p>
                <p class="postaci">
                  The first thing I did was touch these sculptures. They are such that you need to touch them. They are
                  made differently
                  than ordinary sculpture. I am not a sculptor myself, but it seems to me that a sculptor working with a
                  material thinks
                  about the form; about how to define lines and directions in that form, which will be viewed from the
                  outside. At the
                  same time, they must think about how this form exists in space. What will be the relationship between
                  this form and the
                  form of the space it fills? Usual sculptures are diverse. Piotr’s works show two edges: the edge of
                  the stone and the
                  edge of the air. These empty spaces are sometimes openwork. The stones have various fragments and
                  spaces released.
                  Together, they create a much larger sculpture than just what we experience by moving our hand along
                  the edge of the
                  stone. All of Piotr’s stones are pastel: pink, celery green, blue. They create abstract forms. They do
                  not depict
                  anything specific. They do not even refer to any conventional forms found in nature. However, their
                  character reveals a
                  very organic, biological world.
                </p>
                <p class="postaci">
                  In the case of Piotr's work, there is also an extraordinary phenomenon. His sculptures encourage
                  incredible
                  patience — patience in observing and interacting with them. They are transmitters of the patience that
                  Piotr possesses,
                  which allows him to penetrate the nature of stone so profoundly. At the same time, it allows for the
                  revelation of an
                  additional presence in the stone. These released spaces in the stone are precisely Piotr’s angels.
                </p>
                <p class="postaci">
                  When we move our hand over the stone, we touch both the external world, i.e., the plane of the stone
                  wall, as well as
                  the second wall — the wall of air, something that is not there, and that is precisely Piotr’s angel.
                  He has found it for
                  himself and for all of us. [1995]

                  Piotr Kusch's "Signs of Holiness" are inscribed in the empty space of the gallery. The presentation of
                  the artist’s
                  recent works includes wood sculptures and ceramics. Wood and clay are materials in which Piotr Kusch
                  finds and records
                  what is most important in his world and what also defines the place where he lives, Laski.
                </p>
                <p class="postaci">
                  The "Signs of Holiness," born from the experience of the language of touch, refer to the beauty and
                  simplicity preserved
                  in the architecture of the Laski Chapel.
                </p>
                <p class="postaci">
                  Interpreting these works — these signs — requires the viewer to pause, perhaps even close their eyes
                  and trust their
                  watching fingers. Touch can bring us closer to the mystery of Christmas, the Way of the Cross, or
                  Pentecost, as Piotr
                  Kusch shows. It only requires a certain reverent focus, an outstretched hand, bending down, or even
                  kneeling, and slowly
                  moving from one station of the Cross to the next, as in adoration of the cross after the Good Friday
                  service. All this
                  is to truly see and not be a skeptic, but a believer. [2005]

                  Clay is humble. It yields under the artist's fingers, allowing itself to be shaped without resistance.
                </p>
                <p class="postaci">
                  Clay teaches the artist humility, respect for its nature, and responsibility for every touch of the
                  fingers that leaves
                  a mark. Everything can still be improved, changed, perfected.
                </p>
                <p class="postaci">
                  Clay patiently submits, remaining silent. Everything can
                  be started anew. Once more. And again.
                </p>
                <p class="postaci">
                  Through the touch of his hands, the artist breathes life into the clay, extracting it from
                  formlessness, calling it to a
                  new way of existence, and giving it a name. The outline of a head and a horizontal beam cautiously
                  emerges from the
                  background, slowly moving forward, falling, rising, and falling again. It encounters other heads and
                  then stops. It
                  ascends with the cry of sharp thorns, finally finding rest at the very bottom of the rough abyss. And
                  a strangely
                  twisted shape around the head. Yes, it is a lamb. Passover.
                </p>
                <p class="postaci">
                  Here is the final shape. The clay no longer feels the warmth of familiar fingers. It enters the pain
                  of the burning
                  fire. The flame does not destroy but solidifies. After passing through the fire the clay is no longer
                  yielding. It
                  becomes hard and brittle at once. Durable yet fragile, like everything on this earth.

                </p>
                <p class="postaci">
                  Now, the fired, spiritualized clay awaits with impatience the gentle touch of new hands to imprint its
                  mark. Through
                  these hands, it seeks to awaken the spirit. To pass on the fire it contains. [2005]

                  I will just allow myself to express a theological reflection: Piotr carves in stone, wood, and clay.
                  And perhaps it is
                  the clay sculpture that is the most biblical, for in the end, the Lord God formed us from clay, and
                  sculpting in clay is
                  akin to "creatio continua"; it is what God has given us as a calling in the broadest sense of the
                  word—a calling to
                  fully understood creativity. The calling from dead clay sculpture, forming vessels—which by their very
                  shape and
                  function indicate that they are not for themselves but to contain something and thus serve—is
                  particularly moving. Here,
                  some anthropological intuition about sculpture in general, and Piotr’s sculpture in particular, is
                  most revealed because
                  vessels are a very frequent subject in the artist’s work.
                </p>
                <p class="postaci">
                  I have never spoken about this before—but I think this exhibition is an opportunity to express, with
                  great gratitude,
                  Piotr, that what you create transcends the artistic dimension and delves deeply into the human
                  experience of existence,
                  which itself is a clay vessel formed by God to contain a treasure. I am fortunate to very often—three,
                  even sometimes
                  four times a week—celebrate Holy Mass in my chapel using the chalice and paten that you gave me for my
                  episcopal
                  ordination; the chalice is like the vessels you can see here, with its dark blue interior… No
                  sculpture can receive a
                  greater honor than to hold the bread and wine that become the body and blood of our Lord. [2023]

                  Piotr Kusch’s sculptural work is artistically mature, autonomous contemporary sculpture, sensitive to
                  the beauty of
                  form. However, the artist is blind, and his art still faces the risk of being relegated to the realm
                  of work by the
                  disabled, treated under specific rules. It must be acknowledged that, up to a certain point, this was
                  justified. The
                  output from the early years of Piotr Kusch’s artistic activity, despite its undeniably high level, was
                  within the bounds
                  of sculpture created by the blind, with all the specific baggage of the desire to portray a world they
                  imagine, to
                  approach its charm, and to express their experiences through a typically figurative form, arising from
                  the stance of
                  “touching the world.” However, for several years now, the artist has been creating abstract works with
                  exquisite formal
                  charm, becoming a creator recognized and valued in the art world precisely as a sculptor whose works
                  can be treated
                  fully autonomously as contemporary sculpture [...].
                </p>
                <p class="postaci">
                  As a sculptor, he works in granite, limestone, sandstone, and wood, using—driven by a great artistic
                  intuition—the
                  natural beauty and properties of the material. He enjoys realizing soft lines of sloping planes,
                  intricate arrangements
                  of curves, contrasts between convexity and plane, smooth, and sometimes very sharply differentiated
                  sculptural surfaces.
                  He often uses transparency and openwork, introducing air and space into his works in various ways. His
                  sculptures live
                  most fully in the appropriate context of the outdoors, air, light, and nature. They possess a natural
                  biological quality
                  that harmonizes well with what is purely abstract in the artist's art, meticulously calculated in the
                  best sense of the
                  word [...].
                </p>
                <p class="postaci">
                  A particular value of Piotr Kusch’s work is his ability to draw artistic conclusions from his personal
                  limitations,
                  creatively developing this unique, given way of perceiving the world and simultaneously engaging with
                  the material and
                  form. Limitation has become an opportunity for more specific, individual expression. [1996]

                <br><br><br>
                <p class="postaci">
                  For years, I have been closely following the work of Piotr Kusch, a blind sculptor who lives and works
                  in Laski near
                  Warsaw. He possesses genuine talent and great artistic sensitivity, and above all, creative awareness
                  that boldly
                  transcends the limitations of his personal condition. It is this awareness that sets him apart from
                  what might be
                  associated with the work of the blind. Years ago, I published an article about the artist in "Więź."
                  What fascinates me
                  most about Kusch's work is his conscious and sophisticated handling of pure sculptural form, placing
                  him among sculptors
                  who are not defined by adjectives.
                </p>
                <p class="postaci">
                  It is no surprise, then, that the artist has received international scholarships, traveled
                  extensively, and through
                  touch, familiarized himself with a part of the leading achievements in global sculpture.
                </p>
                <p class="postaci">
                  At one point, I was most fascinated by his abstract spatial compositions, arranged so that each side
                  could be a main
                  view. The refined interplay of smoothly intersecting planes and the space within the sculpture as an
                  integral material
                  of the work determined its value.
                </p>
                <p class="postaci">
                  Currently, what enchants me most in his recent work is the bowls. Here, it is not about functional
                  form but about pure
                  artistic expression of their shape as autonomous works of art. Some of these bowls, left in raw clay,
                  are decorated with
                  an incredibly simple yet sophisticated method—throwing the still-hot bowl into grass or hay. The
                  pattern formed from
                  adhered, burnt blades is as simple and natural as nature itself, yet it is immensely refined—like
                  great works of art.
                  Looking at these bowls, I felt as though I had entered an exclusive gallery in Tokyo.

                  Piotr Kusch’s talent, revealed in his peak achievements, disproves the notion that limitations define
                  the horizons of
                  action.[2003]

                  Stone is an ancient element of matter—the most primordial of solidified and extinguished materials. It
                  is a multifaceted
                  symbol, including that of endurance and memory. The myth-creating function of stone has accompanied
                  the entire history
                  of humanity from primitive times to the present day. Stone contains and reflects the primordial
                  structure of the world.
                  It is indestructible, which makes it highly susceptible to symbolic artistic actions, especially those
                  based on
                  reflections about the structure and character of the material world. Stone is also a gravitational
                  center, creating a
                  field of action around itself. Spatial relationships are formed around it, finely sensed and imagined,
                  symbolically
                  represented in Piotr Kusch’s installation "Stone Galaxy" presented at the Gallery of Critics. The
                  power of this
                  realization lies in its symbolic impact.

                <p class="postaci">
                  Regardless of its function within the artistic composition, Piotr Kusch’s individual stones are
                  extraordinarily
                  beautiful and exquisite in their original, each time different forms. Looking at them, I admire the
                  artist's creativity
                  in giving them seemingly unexpected yet very organic shapes, in line with the visible action of the
                  creator's hand. They
                  represent a unique and concrete portrayal of the world's richness.

                <p class="postaci">
                  "Stone Galaxy" is the culmination of the artist’s extensive years of exploration in both figurative
                  and abstract forms.
                  Piotr Kusch, living and working in Laski, is not in a hermitage. He is surrounded by a very active
                  intellectual
                  environment where he finds partners for discussions about his interests, not just artistic ones. His
                  passion is tracking
                  contemporary astrophysical achievements and the construction of the Cosmos. His imagination
                  encompasses the entire
                  Universe and follows its mysteries. In this friendly environment, he had the opportunity to
                  continuously showcase his
                  work in the times when the "Wall" Gallery, run by the particularly art-sensitive director of the
                  school team, Teresa
                  Cwalina, was still here.

                <p class="postaci">
                  An important role in Piotr Kusch’s work has been played by his foreign trips, during which he
                  explored, using the
                  methods available to him, the global achievements of sculpture from ancient Egypt to Henry Moore.
